Kconfiglib
==========

A parser for the Linux kernel's configuration language, Kconfig. Presents
configuration symbols as objects that can be queried and assigned values,
automatically invalidating and reevaluating dependent symbols as needed.
Supports reading and writing .config files. Highly compatible with the C
implementation. See kconfiglib.py for a longer introduction.

Haven't worked on this for a long time. Not sure if it will work with recent
Kconfig versions.
