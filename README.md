# Kconfiglib #

A Python library for doing stuff with Kconfig-based configuration systems. Can
extract information, query and set symbol values, and read and write
<i>.config</i> files. Highly compatible with the <i>scripts/kconfig/\*conf</i>
utilities in the kernel, usually invoked via make targets such as
<i>menuconfig</i> and <i>defconfig</i>.

**Update: Mar 13 2015**

Thanks to a patch from [Philip Craig](https://github.com/philipc) that adds support
for the new `allnoconfig_y` option (which sets the user value of certain symbols
to `y` during `make allnoconfig` to improve coverage) and fixes an obscure issue
with `comment`s inside `choice`s (that didn't affect correctness but made outputs
differ) the test suite now passes with Linux v4.0-rc3. Very little seems to have
changed in the C implementation over the past years, which is nice. :)

One feature is missing: Kconfiglib assumes the modules symbol is `MODULES`, and
will warn if `option modules` is set on some other symbol. Let me know if this
is a problem for you, as adding support shouldn't be that hard. I haven't seen
modules used outside the kernel, where the name is unlikely to change.

## Installation ##

### Installation instructions for the Linux kernel ###

Run the following commands in the kernel root:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git  
    $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch

<i>(Note: The directory name Kconfiglib/ is significant.)</i>

In addition to creating a handy interface, the make targets created by the patch
(`scriptconfig` and `iscripconfig`) are needed to pick up environment variables
set in the kernel makefiles and later referenced in the Kconfig files (<i>ARCH</i>,
<i>SRCARCH</i>, and <i>KERNELVERSION</i> as of Linux v4.0-rc3). The documentation
explains how the make targets are used.

Please tell me if the patch does not apply. It should be trivial to apply
manually.

### Installation instructions for other projects ###

The entire library is contained in [kconfiglib.py](kconfiglib.py). Drop it
somewhere and read the documentation. Make sure Kconfiglib sees environment
variables referenced in the configuration.

## Documentation ##

The (extensive) documentation is generated by running

    $ pydoc kconfiglib

in the <i>Kconfiglib/</i> directory. For HTML output,
use

    $ pydoc -w kconfiglib
    
You could also browse the docstrings directly in [kconfiglib.py](kconfiglib.py).

Please tell me if something is unclear to you or can be explained better. The Kconfig
language has some dark corners.

## Examples ##

The [examples/](examples/) directory contains simple example programs that make use
of Kconfiglib. See the documentation for how to run them.

## Test suite ##

The test suite is run with

    $ python Kconfiglib/testsuite.py

It comprises a set of selftests and a set of compatibility tests that compare
configurations generated by Kconfiglib with configurations generated by
<i>scripts/kconfig/conf</i> for a number of cases. You might want to use the
"speedy" option; see [testsuite.py](testsuite.py).

## Misc. notes ##

Please tell me if you miss some API instead of digging into internals. The
internal data structures and APIs, and dependency stuff in particular, are
unlikely to be exactly what you want as a user (hence why they're internal :).
Patches are welcome too of course. ;)

The test suite failures (should be the only ones) for the following Blackfin
defconfigs on e.g. Linux 3.7.0-rc8 are due to
[a bug in the C implementation](https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/5/458):

 * arch/blackfin/configs/CM-BF537U\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF548-EZKIT\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/BF527-EZKIT-V2\_defconfig  
 * arch/blackfin/configs/TCM-BF537\_defconfig
